If you are using Google Colab, you will need to upload lung_cancer.db file into Google Drive inside a folder AIAP16 which is inside a Colab Notebooks folder. 
If you are using other environments, you will need to change 
``dataset_path = colabPath + "lung_cancer.db"`` to
``dataset_path = <Your path to lung_cancer.db>``
